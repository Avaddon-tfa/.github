## Allure Framework
#### maintained by Qameta Software

Welcome to the main **Allure Framework** repository. 
Allure Framework is a set of integrations and examples for Allure Report, a flexible, lightweight multi-language test reporting tool.

### Testing frameworks adaptors
We did quite a lot of work trying to provide integrations with almost all the common programming languages. 
In case, you are looking for adaptors, use this list:
- [Java](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-java)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-js)
- [Python](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-python)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-ruby) 
- PHP: [PHPUnit](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-phpunit), [Behat](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-behat), and [Codeception](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-codeception)
- [Kotlin and Android](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-kotlin)
- [.NET]: (https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-phpunit)

### CI tools adaptors
There is also a bunch of CI adaptors to make easier-to-share reports:
- [Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/allure-jenkins-plugin/)
- [Bamboo](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-bamboo)
- [TeamCity](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-teamcity)

There is a bunch of less popular adaptors. You may look for them **[here](https://github.com/orgs/allure-framework/repositories)**.
[Here](https://docs.qameta.io/allure-report/) you will find **Allure Report documentation**.
